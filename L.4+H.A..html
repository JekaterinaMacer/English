<p class="p2"><b>Exercise: More finance &amp; money</b></p>
<p class="p3">In the following conversation between two work colleagues (Grazia and Kate), Grazia continues to explain to Kate how he uses and manages his money in his private/personal life.</p>
<p class="p3">From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <b>bold</b> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'Could I ask you how much money you <b>earn</b> from working here? How much money you are paid in your salary?'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'Each year I earn about £70,000. But that is my <b>gross</b> salary. That is before the government removes <b>taxes</b>, the money the government takes from people to pay for its services. So after taxes have been removed, my <b>net</b> salary (the money that I obtain at the end) is about £54,000.'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'It's not a lot of money to live on in London!'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'Yes, I know. But I <b>invested</b> some money in the past. I bought some stocks and shares in companies. So, every year I earn another £6,000 from them. So my total <b>income</b>, the money I receive each year, is £60,000.'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'So, what do you do with your income? What do you <b>spend</b> it on?'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'I spend my money like most people, on food, bills, clothes, holidays etc... I also have some <b>debts</b>. I have credit cards, loans and a mortgage from the bank. I <b>owe</b> the bank a lot of money, money which I <b>borrowed</b> from them in the past to buy things. So, I <b>repay</b> £6,000 to the bank each year.'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'Do you <b>save</b> a lot of money? Put money into a bank account for the future?'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'Yes. I try to save £2,000 each month in the bank.'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'Do you have a car?'</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p3">'I can drive a car, but I don't own a car. With my income, it's too expensive to have a car in London. You have to buy the car and then you have to pay for petrol, parking, insurance etc... I <b>can't afford</b> to have a car in London.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p14"><b>Question no. 3: Why did you leave your last job? / Why are you planning to leave your present job?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Employers want to understand why you plan to make a change, or were forced to make one.</p>
<p class="p3">They try to understand whether they can count with you in a long run, and how it will feel to work with you.  Do you look for good things, or for bad things in job? Do you demand a lot from your colleagues, or do you demand a lot from yourself?</p>
<p class="p3">Regardless of your past experience, you should focus on  good things. Even if they fired you in your last job (for no real reason), try to speak nicely about your former colleagues and employers.</p>
<p class="p3">Nobody wants to hire an employee who will complain about everything, a person who always looks for the worst…</p>

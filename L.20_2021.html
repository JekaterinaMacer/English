<p class="p4"><b>Question no. 9: What are your goals in five years time?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Hint: Every responsible person has some goals. When recruiters ask you about your goals and dreams, first of all they want to hear that you have some goals.</p>
<p class="p4">Secondly, your goals should somehow relate to their business, or at least they should not interfere with their goals and dreams.</p>
<p class="p4">For example, if you dream about running your own business, or about traveling the world, avoid mentioning it in your interview. Companies do not want to hire people who will leave them after a year of employment, to pursue their traveling or entrepreneur dreams…</p>
<p class="p4">Goals do change, and nobody can blame you for changing your mind after working in a company for a few months (or even only for a few weeks). Once in an interview, however, you should say things that will help you to get the job.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>Exercise: Using a bank account</b></p>
<p class="p4">In the following conversation between two friends, Grazia explains to Kate vocabulary connected to bank accounts and using them.</p>
<p class="p4">From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <b>bold</b> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Where can you take out or <b>withdraw</b> the money that you have in a bank account from?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Lots of places now. You can go to a <b>branch</b> of the bank and withdraw your money from there.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'What does a branch mean?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'A branch is the name for the office of a bank which is open for their customers to use. You can also use a machine to withdraw money in your bank account from, which is called a <b>cash machine</b>. And also in some countries you can withdraw money from your bank account at checkouts in some shops/stores when you are buying something. This is called <b>cashback</b>.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'And if I want to add or put money into my bank account. Where can I do that?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'You can <b>deposit</b> or put money into your bank account, in both branches and in some cash machines.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'On a cash machine, can you see your bank account <b>balance</b>? How much money you have in a bank account?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Yes, you can. You can also ask the cashier/bank teller in a branch of the bank to tell you what your balance is too.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'But what if I want to see more information than just the balance of my bank account. What do I do if I want to see the <b>transactions</b> on the account. What money has been deposited in it (when and from who) and what money has been taken out from it (when and to who)?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'All this information is contained in a document called a <b>bank statement</b>. Normally, banks send you a bank statement every month. But you can also go and get one from a branch and from some cash machines.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'And if I want to move money from my bank account to somebody else's bank account. How would I do that? Would I have to withdraw the money and then go with the money in my hand to their bank and deposit in their bank account?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'You can do that, but it's not very safe to walk around with a lot of money. It's safer to write the person a <b>cheque</b>, which is a piece of paper from the bank that people use to pay other people from money in their bank account. The problem with using cheques is that when the person gives their bank the cheque, it takes 3 days to <b>clear</b>. That means that it will be 3 days before the money is moved to their bank account and they can use it.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Is there any better method to move money?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Yes, there is. Banks provide a service to their customers where they move your money electronically to another person's bank account. This is called a <b>bank transfer</b>. You just need to need to know the other person's bank account details, their bank account number etc... When you make a bank transfer the money is moved instantly.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Ok.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'There are two types of bank transfers which are very useful if you have to make regular payments to people or companies and want them to be done automatically. If you need to pay or transfer a fixed amount of money which doesn't change to a company or someone regularly (e.g. every month or 3 months), then you can create a <b>standing order</b> on your bank account. Money will then automatically be repeatedly transferred out of your bank account until you stop the standing order.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'That sounds useful. But that wouldn't work where the amount of money you have to move or transfer changes every month or 3 months. For example, for paying electricity or phone bills.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'No, the amount transferred doesn't change with a standing order. Where the amount of money transferred changes every time, you have to use an automatic bank transfer called a <b>direct debit</b>. Also with a direct debit, the time when money is taken out can change (it doesn't have to go out of your account on a regular date). This type of bank transfer can only be used to transfer money to companies. With a direct debit, you give permission to the company withdrawing money from your bank account to change the amount they take without telling you first.'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'And if I use more money than is in my bank account. What happens?'</p>
<p class="p9"><b>Grazia:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'When you withdraw or use more money than is in your bank account, you are what is called <b>overdrawn</b>. If this happens, you won't be able to withdraw any more money from the account and the bank will charge you money (you have to pay them some money).’</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Home assignment</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Prepare answer for the following question:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>«What are your goals in five years time?»</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s2">Example:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11">I would like to have a managerial role in five years time. However, I understand that I need to learn a lot before it can happen, and I believe that this entry-level position in your company is a perfect starting point for my career.</p>
<p class="p11">I do not dream much about the future. If I have a teaching job, and if I do it well and get a good feedback form my students, it will make me happy in my life. That’s likely my only goal—to be happy, and to do my best in both professional and personal life.</p>

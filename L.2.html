<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Practice</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Exercise: Talking about the economy</i></b></p>
<p class="p4"><i>In the following conversation, two friends (Kate and Anna) are talking about the situation with the economy.</i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in </i><b><i>bold</i></b><i> are.</i></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'So, what's your opinion about the economy at the moment?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'More positive than I was a couple of years ago when the economy was in recession and people were losing their jobs and businesses were closing down.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'I know that a recession is bad, but what actually does it mean?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'A <b>recession</b> is when the size of an economy decreases in two consecutive quarters of the year. For example, January to March and April to June.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'But how do they know if an economy is either decreasing or increasing in size?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'To see how well an economy is doing, economists look at the total value of products and services that are bought in the economy of a country during a specific period of time (e.g. a quarter or a full year). This value is called <b>GDP</b> (Gross Domestic Product). By comparing the amounts of GDP over a period of time, they know how well the economy is doing.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'So, what's the difference between a recession and a depression then?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'A <b>depression</b> is a very bad recession. When a recession continues for two or more years, it is called a depression. Like what happened in the 1930's.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'What caused the economic depression in the 1930's?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Many factors. But the main one was the stock market <b>bubble</b>.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'I don't understand what a bubble means.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'A bubble is when the value of a particular type of product increases dramatically.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'But isn't that a good thing for the economy?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Not really. The price of a product or service mainly depends on two things. Firstly, on the amount of <b>demand</b> there is for it, how many people want to buy or use it. And secondly, on the amount of <b>supply</b> of it, how much there is available to be bought or used. When there is more demand than supply, the price/value of a product or service increases.<br>
Normally, as the price of a product or service increases this encourages other companies to start selling the product or service. This increases the supply and as a consequence the price of the product falls. But with a bubble, this doesn't happen.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Why?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Normally, because there is a limited supply of the product (like land or stocks and shares in companies) or it takes a long time for new supplies to be produced (like housing or buildings). As result, the product can become very overvalued as demand continues to grow and supply doesn't.<br>
When the product becomes too overvalued, people stop buying it.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'So the price falls?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Yes. But normally with bubbles people start to panic and the price falls dramatically, causing people to lose lots of money. Often this can affect the whole economy and cause an <b>economic downturn</b>, where the rate of growth in GDP falls or the size of the economy decreases. If the economic downturn lasts and the size of the economy is contracting/decreasing in size, it can become a recession.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'So what's the opposite of an economic downturn?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'When the size of the economy is growing (GDP is increasing), the economy is in a period of <b>economic expansion</b>. If the level/rate of this expansion/growth is very high and lasts for a long time, it is normally called a <b>boom</b> (also called an economic boom). A boom is like the opposite of a recession.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'I've heard people call economic expansion after a recession a different name, but I can't remember what.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'After a recession has ended and the economy is growing again, it is often called a period of <b>economic recovery</b>.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'So it seems that most countries have a period of boom followed by a recession, then followed by another boom?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Generally that happens. But sometimes countries have a very low rate of economic growth/expansion (less than 2% a year) so they never have a boom. If an economy has this, it is called <b>stagnation</b>.'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Kate:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'But stagnation sounds like a good thing. At least the economy is growing?'</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Anna:</b></p>
<p class="p4">'Not really. A healthy economy should be expanding at more than 2% per year. Economic stagnation shows that something is wrong with the economy. For some reason, companies are not performing very well and not employing more people.’</p>

<p class="p7">Enough with COVID-19 stories</p>
<p class="p7">Talk about something besides the pandemic</p>
<p class="p7">You are starting to repeat yourself</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">So in honor of all you armchair critics</p>
<p class="p7">I bring you today’s top story</p>
<p class="p7">The COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<p class="p7">Look I get it</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">We’ve been dealing with this thing for what - 10 11 months?</p>
<p class="p7">During that time Covid has infected more than 55 million people worldwide With over 1 million deaths</p>
<p class="p7">A whopping 20% of those numbers come from right here In the United States</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Now case numbers are rising for two main reasons</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">First the weather is getting colder for most people around the world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Which means we are spending more time indoors</p>
<p class="p7">Where it’s easier for the virus to spread</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The second factor unfortunately is that we let our guard down</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">People got impatient for life to return to normal</p>
<p class="p7">So countries around the world loosened restrictions</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Businesses reopened and lots of people went back to life as usual</p>
<p class="p7">Right when we started to get the virus under control</p>
<p class="p7">We helped it along</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The upshot is the pandemic is still raging</p>
<p class="p7">Depending on where you live</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">It’s entering a second or even third wave</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">In some places new restrictions are being put in place to stop the spread again</p>
<p class="p7">Which means it’s time to get back to basics</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Starting with social distancing</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">You probably remember the deal</p>
<p class="p7">Keep at least 6 feet away from other people</p>
<p class="p7">Aside from those You live with</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">That gives the virus fewer opportunities to spread around</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Schools are closing again so you may be going back to distance learning</p>
<p class="p7">You can check out our movie on that to brush up on your skills</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">This stuff is really hard especially with the holidays coming up</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Health officials asking people to celebrate with just their household</p>
<p class="p7">And avoid traveling</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">I always look forward to seeing my cousins</p>
<p class="p7">But this year we are going virtual</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">These are hard sacrifices</p>
<p class="p7">But remember what we do now has the power to save lives</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">There are a few other Simple things we can do to help people stay healthy</p>
<p class="p7">Like washing your hands frequently</p>
<p class="p7">Scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds to make sure you don’t miss any spots</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">And whenever you leave home wear a mask even if you’re feeling fine</p>
<p class="p7">Because lots of people who are infected with coronavirus show no symptoms</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p7">With a mask on fewer of the droplets your generate from breathing Coughing and sneezing will spread Which gives the virus less opportunity to spread too</p>
<p class="p7">It’s an extra layer of protection for you and for everyone around you</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Did you put extra weights in there?</p>
<p class="p7">Can someone give me a hand?</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

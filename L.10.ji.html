<p class="p3">When Charles Dickens got sick of his wife, he came to John Forster and asked:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“John, I hate Catherine. I need a divorce. Can you <b>estimate</b> the costs? ”</p>
<p class="p3">John did not accurately calculate the cost of the divorce. He quickly named the figure and therefore used the word estimate:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“You know Charles, my <b>estimate</b> is three thousand pounds.”</p>
<p class="p3">Charles Dickens was disappointed - and never divorced.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Charles Dickens was fond of flattery. He often asked John Forster:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">"John, can you <b>evaluate</b> my role in the world history?"</p>
<p class="p3">Since Dickens used the word evaluate, John had to evaluate Dickens' role in history in detail and carefully. And Dickens crumpled his beard, smiled and bought Forster free beer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s2"><b>Question no. 10: Tell us about your greatest achievement.</b></span></p>
<p class="p4">Employers try to find out if you have just “gone to the job”, or if you actually tried to achieve something while doing your routine.</p>
<p class="p4">Whenever possible, you should speak about your achievements from the perspective of an employer (helping them to find new customers, helping them to improve their reputation, building good atmosphere on the workplace, earning more money, etc), rather than achievements from your own perspective (getting promoted, earning a degree or certification, etc).</p>
<p class="p4">If you have no other option, however, you can talk about personal promotion, employee of the month award, or other recognition of your good work for the employer.</p>
<p class="p4">If you apply for your first job, however, you can speak about achievements from your personal life. For example, a chain smoker who managed to quit smoking recently shows their strong determination and will.</p>

<p class="p4">When I worked in sales at ABC Inc., our sales volume grew by twenty percent or more each year. It was a team work, and we helped their business a lot.</p>
<p class="p4">I have become a better person over the years. I learned to listen to others, and to see the good things in people, which is something I had struggled to do early in life. I consider this my biggest achievement, since it made my life better, and I hope people enjoy my company more.</p>

<p class="p4">Regardless of your past experience, you should focus on  good things. Even if they fired you in your last job (for no real reason), try to speak nicely about your former colleagues and employers.</p>

<p class="p10">The duties were repetitive, and I felt I was not moving forward anymore. That’s why I left, and decided to apply for your offer, as I really see a potential for learning and growing in your company.</p>
